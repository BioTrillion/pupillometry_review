# Other pupillary responses


## Constriction after visual change

Any kind of visual change, even if overall luminance does not increase, causes the pupil to constrict. The profile of this response is similar to the pupil light response (PLR), although transient and less strong [REFS]. %FigGratingResponse shows the pupillary constriction that is triggered by a reversal of a checkerboard pattern, such that all dark squares become bright, and all bright squares become dark.

Strikingly, even if a visual change constitutes an overall luminance decrement, the pupil still initially constricts (after which, of course, it dilates). %FigGratingResponse2 shows the pupillary constricton that is triggered by the transition from a bright/dark checkerboard to a completely dark display.

To my knowledge, the origin of this response is not clear, although there have been two main suggestions. Gamlin and colleagues, who have done much of the research in this area, suggest that pupillary responses to visual change are really distinct from other pupillary responses, and arise from some (unknown) cortical process that leads to a temportarily reduced inhibition of the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus [REF]. Support for this claim comes from the finding that pupillary responses to visual change are reduced in the affected visual field of patients with cortical blindsight [REF]; in other words, pupillary responses to visual change are impaired when the visual cortex is also impaired, even when subcortical pathways are still intact; this suggests that these pupillary responses have a cortical origin. (The tacit assumption here is that the pupil light response [PLR] does not have any cortical involvement, which is doubtful.)

Another explanation is that pupillary responses to visual change reflect the bright-dark assymetry in the PLR [@Math2013Plos;@Math2015Intra]. To illustrate this, consider what happens during a checkerboard reversal: Some squares go from dark to bright, thus driving a pupillary constriction; other squares go from bright to dark, thus driving a pupillary dilation. Crucially, constriction is much faster than dilation (see %FigLightResponse), and the combined effect may therefore be an initial constriction, which disappears as dilation eventually catches up; this would at least superficially seem to explain the pattern shown in %FigGratingResponse.

An explanation in terms of the PLR is attractive because it avoids the need to postulate a new and strange class of pupillary responses; but it does have trouble accommodating the finding that the pupil even constricts after visual changes that constitute only luminance decreases. However, this may be a side effect of a Mach Band-like phenomenon that occurs in many displays. To illustrate, consider that in a checkerboard the centers of dark tiles appear less dark than the edges, because the darkness of the edges is boosted by the contrast with the adjacent bright edges. When the bright squares disappear, this darkness-boosting contrast disappears as well; this may effectively function as a local luminance increment, thus causing the pupillary constriction that is shown in %FigGratingResponse2.

Both explanations of visual-change-induced pupillary constriction described above are possible, but they are also highly speculative. At this point, all we can really say is that visual change triggers the best kind of pupillary respones: mysterious ones.


## Constriction after blinks

Blinks of the eye also drive a pupillary constriction. As shown in %FigBlinkResponse, the profile of this response is again similar to that of the PLR.
