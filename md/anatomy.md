# Anatomy and neural pathways


## Anatomy of the eye

The pupil is a transparent opening in the center of the eye, through which light reaches first the the lens in the front of the eye, and then the retina in the back of the eye. The pupil normally appears black, because the inside of the eye is dark. (However, the pupil can appear red when the inside of the eye is illuminated and viewed from the angle of illumination, such as on a flash photograph.) The diameter of the pupil varies between roughly 2 and 8 mm, which means that the pupil can change the amount of light that enters the eye by a factor of roughly 16.

The colored area around the pupil is the iris. The white tissue around the iris is called the sclera. The transparent tissue that covers the iris and the pupil (but not the sclera) is the cornea.


## Pupillary pathways

Pupil size is controlled by two pathways that are largely separate: the constriction pathway and the dilation pathway [For reviews on the neuroanatomy of pupillary responses, see @Szabadi2012;@SamuelsSzabadi2008;@Kardon2005;@McDougalGamlin2005].


### The constriction pathway

Pupillary constriction is controlled by the *iris sphincter muscle*. The iris sphincter muscle encircles the pupil like a cord that reduces the size of the pupil when it contracts. The iris sphincter is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in homeostasis (i.e. keeping the body in stable condition). The constriction pathway is a subcortical pathway that connects the retina to the iris sphincter muscle (%FigPathways::a).

- As light falls on the retina, nerve impulses are sent along the optic nerve to optic chiasma.
- The optic chiasma combines input from the retina in both eyes, re-divides it based on visual field, and sends it to the pretectal nucleus; that is, information from the left visual field goes to the pretectal nucleus in the right hemisphere, and the right visual field goes to the left pretectal nucleus.
- From the PN, information is sent to the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus. Each EW nucleus receives input from the left and right pretectal nuclei, thus combining information from the left and right visual fields.
- From the EW nucleus, information is sent through the Oculomotor Nerve (III) to the Ciliary Ganglion, which is located just behind the eye.
- From the Ciliary Ganglion, information is sent via the short ciliary nerves to the iris sphincter muscle.

The constriction pathway as described corresponds to those areas that are commonly considered to be crucial, and is essentially that of the pupillary light response. Notably absent is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the Thalamus, which, in many unreferenced descriptions that can be found online, receives sits between the retina and the EW nucleus. However, more authorative reviews [e.g. @Kardon2005] assume that retina-geniculate pathway is only involved vision, and not in pupillary responses.

The pathway that controls the pupillary near response is documented less well, but likely consists of projections from the visual cortex to the EW nucleus, after which the pathway is identical as the one described above.

### The dilation pathway

Pupillary dilation is controlled by the *iris dilator muscle*. The dilator muscle consists of fibers that are oriented radially, and connect the exterior of the iris with the interior. When the dilator muscle contracts, it pulls the interior of the iris outward, thus increasing the size of the pupil. The iris dilator muscle is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in arousal, wakefulness, and the fight-or-flight response. The dilation pathway is a subcortical pathway that starts at the locus coeruleus (LC) and and connects to the iris dilator muscle (%FigPathways::b).

- The LC is especially active when an organism is awake and alert; that is, the LC reflects arousal. The LC projects to the intermedio-lateral column (IML) of the spinal cord.
- The IML projects to the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), located just outside the spinal cord.
- The SCG projects, via a complicated network of nerves, to the iris dilator muscle.

The neural pathway that leads to pupillary dilation is less well understood than that leading to constriction. The pathway described here corresponds to those areas that are commonly considered to be crucial. But many more areas are involved, notably the Hypothalamus, which in some reviews takes the central place that I have assigned here to the LC [e.g. @Kardon2005].


### Interactions between the constriction and dilation pathways

Although the constriction and dilation pathways are roughly separate, they interact in at least three ways.

- The LC inhibits the EW nucleus; that is, LC activity does not only cause pupil dilation through the sympathetic dilation pathway, but also by inhibiting the parasympathetic constriction pathway at the level of the EW nucleus.
- The effect of light is twofold. First, and most directly, light triggers pupillary constriction through the constriction pathway described above. But light also induces wakefulness, and activates the dilation pathway, by a connection through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), part of the hypothalamus, and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) to the LC. In other words, light drives both pupillary constriction and dilation.
- Third the constriction pathway inhibits the iris dilator muscle. Similarly, the dilation pathways inhibits the iris sphincter muscle.
