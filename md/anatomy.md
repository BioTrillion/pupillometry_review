# Anatomy and neural pathways


## Anatomy of the eye

The *pupil* is a transparent opening in the center of the eye (%FigEye). Light passes through the surface of the lens that is exposed by the pupil, and is focused onto the retina in the back of the eye. The pupil normally appears black, because the inside of the eye is dark, and not because the pupil is an opaque black surface. (This becomes apparent when a camera flash illuminates the inside of the eye, which under a certain angle makes the pupil appear red.) The diameter of the human pupil varies between roughly 2 and 8 mm; therefore, the pupil can change the amount of light that enters the eye by a factor of roughly 16. The colored area around the pupil is the *iris*, and it contains the muscles that control pupil size (%FigMuscles). The white tissue around the iris is called the *sclera*. The transparent tissue that covers the iris and the pupil (but not the sclera) is the *cornea*.

## Neural pathways

Pupil size is controlled by two pathways that, although interconnected, are often considered distinct: the *parasympathetic constriction pathway* and the *sympathetic dilation pathway*. Different reviews highlight different aspects of these pathways. Below I focus on those areas and connections for which several authoritative reviews agree that they are important for pupil control [see @Kardon2005;@Szabadi2012;@SamuelsSzabadi2008;@McdougalGamlin2008;@WangMunoz2015Curr]. The information below is adapted from these reviews, and detailed references can be found there, especially in @Kardon2005 and @McdougalGamlin2008.


### The constriction pathway

Pupil constriction is controlled by the *iris sphincter muscle*. The iris sphincter muscle encircles the pupil like a cord that reduces the size of the pupil when it contracts (%FigMuscles::a). The iris sphincter is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in homeostasis (i.e. keeping the body in stable condition); the link between pupil constriction and the parasympathetic nervous explains why pupils are relatively small at rest. The constriction pathway is a subcortical pathway that connects the retina to the iris sphincter muscle (%FigPathways::a).

The constriction pathway as described here corresponds to those areas that are commonly considered crucial for pupil constriction, and is essentially that of the pupil light response (PLR). Notably absent is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which, in many unreferenced descriptions that can be found online, sits between the retina and the EWN. However, more authoritative reviews [e.g. @Kardon2005] assume that the retina-geniculate pathway is only involved in vision, and not in pupil responses.


- As light falls on the retina, nerve impulses are sent along the optic nerve to the optic chiasma.
- The optic chiasma combines input from the retina in both eyes, re-organizes it based on visual field, and sends it to the pretectal nucleus (PN); that is, information from the left visual field goes to the PN in the right hemisphere, and the right visual field goes to the left PN.
- From the PN, information is sent to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN). Each EWN receives input from the left and right PN, thus combining information from the left and right visual fields; that is, both the left and right EWN receive input from both eyes and both visual fields.
- From the EWN, information is sent via the Oculomotor Nerve (III) to the ciliary ganglion (CG), which is located just behind the eye.
- From the CG, information is sent via the short ciliary nerves to the iris sphincter muscle.

### The dilation pathway

Pupil dilation is controlled by the *iris dilator muscle*. The dilator muscle consists of fibers that are oriented radially, and connect the exterior of the iris with the interior. When the dilator muscle contracts, it pulls the interior of the iris outward, thus increasing the size of the pupil (%FigMuscles::b). The iris dilator muscle is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the autonomic nervous system that is involved in arousal, wakefulness, and the fight-or-flight response; the link between pupil dilation and the sympathetic nervous system explains why pupils are relatively large when someone is aroused. The dilation pathway is a subcortical pathway that starts at the hypothalamus and the locus coeruleus (LC) and connects to the iris dilator muscle (%FigPathways::b).

- The LC is especially active when an organism is aroused, awake, and alert; that is, the LC reflects arousal. (But see the section on the Adaptive Gain theory for a more nuanced discussion of LC function.) The LC projects to the intermedio-lateral column (IML) of the spinal cord.
- The hypothalamus is a complicated structure with many connections and subnuclei; however, in the context of pupil dilation its role is similar to that of the LC: activity in the hypothalamus reflects arousal and wakefulness, and it projects to the IML. The hypothalamus and LC also have reciprocal excitatory connections.
- The IML projects to the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), located just outside the spinal cord.
- The SCG projects, via a complicated network of nerves, to the iris dilator muscle.

The neural pathway that leads to pupil dilation is understood less well than that leading to constriction, especially because it involves brain areas, such as the LC and hypothalamus, that are involved in many aspects of cognition. However, the pathway described here corresponds to those areas that are commonly considered to be crucial.


### Interactions between the constriction and dilation pathways

Although the constriction and dilation pathways are roughly distinct, they interact in at least three ways.

- The LC inhibits the EWN; that is, LC activity causes pupil dilation not only by activating the sympathetic dilation pathway, but also by inhibiting the parasympathetic constriction pathway at the level of the EWN. It has even been suggested that this is the primary pathway that underlies pupil dilation in response to arousal and mental effort [@Steinhauer2004].
- Similarly, the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC), which are traditionally not considered part of the pupil pathways, inhibit the EWN; presumably, these inhibitory connections drive the rapid pupil dilation that accompanies the orienting response [@WangMunoz2015Curr].
- The effect of light is twofold. First, and most directly, light activates the constriction pathway, causing the pupil to constrict. But light also induces wakefulness, and activates the dilation pathway, via a connection through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is part of the hypothalamus, and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) to the LC. In other words, light drives pupil constriction through a direct pathway, and pupil dilation through an indirect pathway.
