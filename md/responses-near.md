# The pupil near response


## Profile

The pupil near response (PNR), also called the pupil near reflex, is the constriction of the pupil in response to looking at a nearby object, and the dilation of the pupil in response looking at a far-away object. The PNR is certainly the least studied, and perhaps the least understood of all pupil responses. The profile of the PNR, shown in %FigNearResponse, is similar to that of the pupil light response (PLR).

  caption: The profile of a typical pupil near response. This figure shows data of myself while I'm shifting gaze from a far-away to a nearby point (prompted by an auditory cue at 0 s) and back again (prompted by another auditory cue at 10 s; N=10 trials). The x axis indicates time since the onset of the auditory cue to shift gaze. The y axis indicates pupil size as a proportion of pre-stimulus pupil size. Errors bars reflect the standard error. All data shown in this figure and others is available through the URL provided at the end of the article.

In the example data, again from myself, shown in %FigNearResponse, the PNR is elicited by an auditory cue at 0 s to shift gaze from far (± 2 m) to near (± 0.1 m), and a second auditory cue at 10 s to shift back from near to far. This shift of gaze was such that, except for vergence eye movements, eye position did not change. The profile of the resulting PNR looks as follows:

- [Far to near] 0 - 0.6 s: This is the latency period of the PNR, relative to the cue onset. This time comprises both the time it takes to process the cue and to shift focus from far to near, and the latency of the PNR proper.
- [Far to near] 0.6 s - 2 s: The pupil constricts strongly until it reaches its minimum size.
- [Far to near] 2 s - 10 s: The pupil remains fully constricted. There is no notable pupil escape in the PNR.
- [Near to far] 10 s - 12 s: The pupil recovers to its original size. This redilation is slower than the constriction; however, it is faster than the redilation after a light response (see %FigLightResponse).


## The near triad

The PNR is part of three eye movements, the near triad, that usually [but not necessarily, e.g. @Stakenburg1991] occur together [@MaysGamlin1995;@McdougalGamlin2008]. Besides the PNR, the near triad includes: *vergence*, the inward rotation of the eyes to look at something nearby and the outward rotation of the eyes to look at something far away; and *accomodation*, the curving of the eye's lens to focus on a nearby object and the flattening of the lens to focus on a far-away object.


## Neural basis

The output pathway of the PNR is the same as that of the PLR, projecting from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN) to the iris sphincter muscle (see %FigPathways::a). However, unlike the PLR, the PNR does not appear to be driven directly by a subcortical pathway, but rather by cortical projections to the EWN [@McdougalGamlin2008]. Which cortical areas are involved in the PNR is not entirely clear; however, there are projections from the frontal eye fields (FEF) and parietal cortex to the EWN that are involved in vergence movements [@Gamlin2002]. Because of the strong association between vergence and the PNR, and the central role of the EWN in pupil constriction, it is possible that these projections also play a role in the PNR.


## Cognitive influences

To my knowledge, only two studies have directly investigated cognitive influences on the PNR: one published study by @Enright1987VisRes; and one of our own studies that we are currently finalizing [@Van+der+mijn2017]. The results of these studies are interesting yet puzzling, and more research is certainly needed.

@Enright1987VisRes asked participants to look at two-dimensional drawings of three-dimensional boxes (i.e. drawings that conveyed a sense of perspective). Participants viewed these drawings monocularly, with one eye covered. Participants fixated either on the corner of the box that appeared nearby, or on the corner that appeared far away. Even though the drawing was in a single plane, participants nevertheless made vergence movements as if they looked at the nearby or far-away corner of a real three-dimensional box. But there were no corresponding pupil-size changes: the pupil was not smaller when participants looked at the nearby corner, indicating that vergence was not accompanied by a PNR.

However, the results were very different when participants viewed so-called Neckercubes. A Neckercube is an ambiguous box-like drawing, in which the same corner can be perceived as either nearby or far away. Participants looked at this corner, and indicated whether they subjectively perceived it as the nearby or far-away corner. The results for vergence movements were more-or-less the same as for the regular box drawings (although slightly weaker), but vergence was now accompanied by exceptionally large pupil responses: the pupil was smaller when the corner was subjectively nearby as compared to when it was subjectively far away. However, while the direction of the effect was consistent with a PNR, the size of the effect was unrealistically large, casting doubt on whether it truly was a PNR, or rather an artifact of some unrecognized confound.

In one of our own experiments [@Van+der+mijn2017], we used a setup consisting of three separate displays: a central fixation display at an intermediate distance, a display on the left that was nearby, and a display on the right that was far away (or vice versa). Participants either covertly attended to the nearby or far-away display (while keeping gaze on the central display), or, in a different condition, made an eye movement to the nearby or far-away display. In the covert-attention condition, we found that pupil size did not change as a function of whether participants covertly attended to the nearby or far-away display; this suggests that, unlike the PLR [e.g. @Binda2013Enhances;@Mathôt2013Plos], the PNR is not modulated by covert shifts of attention. In the eye-movement condition, we found that the pupil responded to the distance of the to-be-looked-at display, and, importantly, did so with an extremely low latency; this is reminiscent of the effect of eye-movement preparation on the PLR [@MathôtLinden2015Prep;@Ebitz2014]. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, because distance is related to other factors that might also affect pupil size, such as brightness and size (i.e. from a retinal point of view, nearby things are generally brighter and larger than far-away things).

In conclusion, it is unclear whether the PNR is affected by cognitive influences. Results from the, as far as I know, only two studies that have investigated this issue suggest that, if cognitive influences on the PNR exist, they are likely smaller than similar influences on the PLR [@Van+der+mijn2017;@Enright1987VisRes].


## Function

The main function of the PNR is likely to increase depth of field for near vision. As described in the section on the PLR, you can see sharply across a wider range of distances with a small pupil than you can with a large pupil [@Campbell1957;@CharmanWhitefoot1977]. The reason that a large depth of field is especially useful for near vision, is that depth of field is much smaller for nearby than far-away objects; that is, you can simultaneously and sharply see two objects at ten and eleven meters distance, but you cannot simultaneously and sharply see two objects at half and one-and-a-half meters distance.
