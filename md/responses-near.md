# The pupil near response


## Profile

The pupil near response (PNR), also called the pupil near reflex, is the constriction of the pupil in response to looking at a nearby object, and the dilation of the pupil in response looking at a far-away object. The PNR is certainly the least studied, and probably the least well-understood of all pupillary responses. The profile of the PNR, shown in %FigNearResponse, is similar to that of the pupil light response (PLR).

TODO: Description


## The near triad

The PNR is part of three eye movements, the near triad, that usually [but not necessarily, e.g. @Stakenburg1991], occur together [@MaysGamlin1995;@McDougalGamlin2005]:

- vergence, the inward rotation of the eyes to look at something nearby, and the outward rotation of the eyes to look at something far away;
- accomodation, rounding of the eye's lens to focus on a nearby object, and the flattening of the lens to focus on a far-away object; and
- the PNR.


## Neural basis

The output pathway of the PNR is the same as that of the PLR, projecting from the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus [%FigConstrictionPathway] to the iris sphincter muscle. However, unlike the PLR, the PNR does not appear to be driven directly by a subcortical pathway, but rather by cortical projections to the EW nucleus [@McDougalGamlin2005]. Which cortical areas are involved in the PNR is not entirely clear; however, there are projections from the frontal eye fields and parietal cortex to the EW nucleus that are involved in vergence movements [@Gamlin2002]. Because of the strong association between vergence and the PNR, and the central role of the EW nucleus in pupillary constriction, it is possible that these projections also play a role in the PNR.


## Function

The main function of the PNR is, presumably, to increase depth of field for near vision. As described in the section on the PLR, a small pupil increases depth of field [@Campbell1957;@CharmanWhitefield1977]. The reason that a large depth of field is especially useful for near vision, is that depth of field is much smaller for nearby than far-away objects; that is, you can simultaneously and sharply see two objects at ten and eleven meters distance, but you cannot simultaneously and sharply see two objects at half and one-and-a-half meters distance.


## Cognitive influences

To my knowledge, only a single study has investigated cognitive influences on the PNR, and its results are interesting yet puzzling.

@Enright1897VisRes asked participants to look at (two-dimensional) drawings of (three-dimensional) boxes. Participants viewed monocularly, with one eye covered. Participants fixated either on the corner of the box that appeared nearby, or on the corner that appeared far away. Even though the drawing was in a single plane, participants nevertheless made vergence movements as if they looked at the nearby or far-away corner of a real three-dimensional box. However, there were no corresponding pupil size changes: The pupil was not smaller when participants looked at the nearby corner, indicating that vergence was not accompanied by a PNR.

However, the results were very different when participants viewed so-called Neckercubes. A Neckercube is an ambiguous box-like drawing, in which the same corner can be perceived as either nearby or far away. Participants now viewed this corner, and indicated whether they subjectively perceived it as the nearby or far-away corner. The results for vergence movements were more-or-less the same as for the regular box drawings (although slightly weaker), but this time vergence was accompanied by exceptionally large pupillary responses: The pupil was smaller when the corner was subjectively nearby than when it was subjectively far away. The direction of this effect was consistent with a PNR, but its size was unrealistically large, casting doubt on whether it truly was a PNR, or rather an artifact of some unrecognized confound.

In conclusion, it is unclear whether the PNR is affected by cognitive influences. The recent studies showing that this is the case for the PLR suggest that this may be the case, but compelling evidence is so far lacking.
