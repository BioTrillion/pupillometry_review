# The psychosensory pupil response

## Profile

> Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate. [@Loewenfeld1958, p. 237]

The pupil dilates after an arousing stimulus, thought, or emotion. Here I call this the psychosensory pupil response (PPR), but is sometimes also called reflex dilation, arousal-related dilation, or effort-related dilation. The profile of the PPR varies strongly, depending on how it is elicited, but %FigPsychoSensory shows a typical PPR elicited by a sound.

After decades of intensive study on the psychosensory pupil response, Loewenfeld's quote from 1958 is still a fair summary of the state of the art; anything that somehow activates the mind also causes the pupil to dilate.

In this section I will discuss several factors that cause the pupil to dilate, but this selection mostly reflects the history of the field, which has focused on emotions, mental effort, attention, and working memory. In my view, all these factors cause the pupil dilate for the same reason: because they activate the mind.
