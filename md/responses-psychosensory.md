# The psychosensory pupil response


## Profile

> Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate. [@Loewenfeld1958, p. 237]

The pupil dilates after an arousing stimulus, thought, or emotion. Here I call this the psychosensory pupil response, but is sometimes also called reflex dilation, arousal-related dilation, or effort-related dilation. After decades of intensive study on the psychosensory pupil response, Loewenfeld's quote from 1958 is still a fair summary of the state of the art; anything that somehow activates the mind also causes the pupil to dilate.

In this section I will discuss several factors that cause the pupil to dilate, but this selection mostly reflects the history of the field, which has focused on emotions, mental effort, attention, and working memory. In my view, all these factors cause the pupil dilate for the same reason: because they activate the mind.


## Orienting response

Sudden events (sounds, movements, painful touch, etc.) trigger an orienting response: your head turns and your eyes move to orient toward the source of the event; your muscles tense, you start to sweat, your heart slows down, and your pupils dilate to prepare for whatever may happen next--possibly something bad.

The slight pupil dilation shown in %FigSound is such an orienting response. To be sure, it is a tiny response to a harmless auditory stimulus; but it is nevertheless a weak variation of an orienting response. In general, an orienting response is evident in pupil-size data as a fast and short-lasting pupillary dilation that peaks around 0.5 s after the event that elicited the response.


## Mental effort and arousal

In a series of seminal studies, Hess and Polt [REF], and later Kahneman and Beatty [REF] showed that pupil size was reliable indicator of mental effort and arousal. [This had already been known for a long time, but these studies brought pupillometry to the attention of psychologists. For historic reviews, see @BeattyLucero2005;@Loewenfeld1958.] This type of PPR is endogenous (i.e. generated by an internal cognitive event) and its size and profile is therefore highly variable, presumably reflecting how mental effort and arousal evolve over time [e.g. @Math2015JGen].

In one study, Hess and Polt [REF] had participants perform mental calculations of different levels of difficulty; for example, 4x4 would be easy, whereas 19x27 would be difficult. They observed that pupil size reflected the difficulty of the calculation: the harder the calculation, the larger the pupil. Similarly, Kahneman and Beatty had participants memorize digits, and varied the number of to-be-remembered digits. In line with the fidings of Hess and Polt [REF], they observed that pupil size reflected the number of digits that were memorized. Taken together, these two studies, as well as many others that have been conducted since [reviewed in REF], showed that pupil size reflects mental effort, cognitive load, or cognitive intensity. Many different terms have been used, but the general finding is clear: Whatever activates the mind causes the pupil to dilate.

Hess and Polt [REF] reported a similar finding for arousal. They had participants look at images that varied in how arousing they were, and to whom they were arousing. The results were clear: When participants viewed arousing images, their pupils dilated, but only when these images were actually arousing to them; for example, men's pupils dilated most to images of naked women, whereas women's pupils dilated most to images of babies and naked men. In a follow-up study, Hess and Polt [REF] showed that this effect was even modulated by sexual orientation: Gay men's pupils dilated most to images of naked men, whereas gay women's pupils dilated most to images of naked women. These studies, as well as many others conducted since, show that pupil size reflects arousal. In terms of pupil size, arousal and mental effort do not appear to be very different; both activate the mind, and both cause the pupils to dilate.

Since the seminal studies by Hess and Polt [REF] and Kahneman and Beatty [REF], whose conclusions still hold, there has been little theoretical development in this area (with the exception of the adaptive-gain theory discussed below). But pupillometry has become a standard tool to measure cognitive processing. For example, pupil size has been used a marker of how difficult it is to parse lexical structures [REF JustCarpenter], and how much difficulty hearing-impaired people have in understanding others [REF Zekveld].

## The adaptive-gain theory

The adaptive-gain theory, proposed first by @AstonCohen2005, is an influential theory that primarily deals with the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) in regulating behavior. Because LC activity correlates strongly with pupil size [REF], pupillometry has become a popular tool to test predictions of the adaptive-gain theory [REF]; and, in my view, this theory has become one of the more interesting frameworks to think about PPRs.

According to @AstonCohen2005, there are two distinct modes of behavior, which they refer to as exploitation and exploration. Exploitation refers to a behavioral state in which you are engaged in a single task, such as eating or reading a book; in this state, you are 'exploiting' the rewards that a task has to offer, such as food or the pleasure of reading. Exploitation is associated with intermediate, phasic (bursty) LC activity, and, consequently, an intermediate pupil size. Exploration refers to a state in which you are easily distracted and tend to switch from one task to another; in this state, you are 'exploring' different tasks, to find the one that offers the highest reward. Exploration is associated with high, tonic (sustained) LC activity, and, consequently, large pupils. (Low LC activity and small pupils are associated with sleepiness.)

According to the adaptive-gain theory, animals alternate exploitation and exploration to optimize rewards. The idea is simple: Imagine that you are hungry and open a bag of chips. Initially, while you are still hungry, eating the chips offers a high reward, and you therefore continue 'exploiting' this activity. But after some time, you are no longer hungry, and eating chips is no longer rewarding; at this point you switch to exploration, and look for something that offers a higher reward than eating chips. For example, you may start browsing Facebook. It is initially rewarding to see what all your friends have been up to, and you therefore 'exploit' Facebook for a while; but once you've seen all new posts, reward declines, and you again switch to exploration to find a new, more rewarding activity. And so the exploitation-exploration cycle continues.

The adaptive-gain theory has a high face validity: It makes a lot of sense that animals indeed alternate between exploration and exploitation; in a way it is not even really a theory, but rather a description of animal behavior. However, the claim that you can track these switches in behavior mode using pupillometry is new and fascinating. In my view, evidence for this claim is still preliminary, but it is certainly consistent with several interesting studies.

[DESCRIBE ONE OF NIEUWENHUIS'S STUDIES]

The adaptive-gain theory primarily focuses on slow fluctuations in pupil size that occur over several seconds, minutes, or even hours. But could it also explain the fast and transient PPR that is elicited by sudden movements, sounds, etc.? Possibly yes. Such sudden events indicate potential danger, which may trigger an immediate shift from exploitation toward exploration, and a concommitant pupil dilation; once you have oriented toward the sudden event and decided that there is actually no danger, you go back to whatever task you were engaged in, resulting a constriction of the pupil.

In summary, the adaptive-gain theory provides a refined description of what PPRs reflect. Its distinction between exploitation (small pupils) and exploration (large pupils) is similar to the traditional distinction between calmness (small pupils), and arousal and effort (large pupils)--but it is more specific, and theoretically more interesting.


## Function

Researchers have displayed a remarkable lack of interest in the question of why the PPR exists: Why does the pupil dilate in response to such a wide range of stimuli as sounds, mental effort, and arousal? How does this help us to see the world better, if indeed it does? Consequently, unlike the PLR and PNR, the function of the PPR is mostly unknown. Several researchers have even explicitly rejected the idea that the PPR has any function at all. For example, Beatty and Lucero-Wagoner [-@BeattyLucero2005, p. 142] state that "these exceedingly tiny pupillary movements are too small to be of visual consequence."

In my view, such easy dismissal is unsatisfying. Not only can tiny effects confer an evolutionary benefit [recall the quote by @Barlow1972], but it is not clear to me that the PPR is necessarily a tiny effect. Of course, in a laboratory, psychologists use weak stimuli, such as pictures of naked women [REF] or mental calculations [REF]. And these evoke smallish pupillary dilations, although the 20% diameter change observed by Hess and Polt [REF] is far from negligable. And my own example PPR shown in %FigSound is indeed tiny, because I did not feel like subjecting myself to fear of death or extremely loud noises. But an animal that, confronted with a predator, fears for its life surely shows stronger pupil dilation. To my knowledge, how much pupils dilate under extreme conditions is unclear (and perhaps best left unclear for ethical considerations), and it certainly varies strongly from species to species. But the small PPRs that are observed in the laboratory are likely not representative of PPRs in those extreme conditions in which, perhaps, they matter most.

So how do PPRs help visual perception? Stefan Van der Stigchel and I [@Math2015CurrDirr] recently proposed an explanation. As I described in the sections on the PLR and the PNR, large pupils have both advantages, notably increased visual sensitivity, and disadvantages, notably decreased depth of field and visual acuity. Depending on, among other things, the amount of available light, the advantages outweight the disadvantages, or the other way around. More specifically, in darkness, you need all the visual sensivity they can get, and your pupils therefore dilate; but in brightness, visual sensitivity is very high (because light is abundant), and the pupils therefore constrict to increase visual acuity and depth of field.

Presumably, the optimal trade-off between visual sensitivity and visual acuity is not fixed, but depends on the situation. More specifically, if you are calmly focused on a task [exploitation, in the terminology of @AstonCohen2005], visual acuity may be especially important; for example, reading requires fine discrimination, and thus high visual acuity, as do many other tasks. Therefore, in such situations, the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and acuity may shift toward acuity, causing the pupils to constrict. In contrast, if you are aroused and on the look out for danger and opportunity [exploration, in the terminology of @AstonCohen2005], visual sensitivity may be especially important; for example, a subtle movement somewhere may indicate danger, and it needs to be detected as quickly as possible. Therefore, in such situations, the trade-off may shift toward sensitivity, causing the pupils to dilate.

In summary, the function of the PPR may be to, depending on the situation, find the optimal the trade-off between visual sensitivity and acuity. In some situation, sensitivity is more important than acuity, and the pupil may therefore dilate; in other situations, acuity is more important than sensitivity, and the pupil may therefore constrict.
