The pupil responds to three distinct kinds of stimuli: The pupil constricts in response to brightness (the pupil light response), constricts in response to near fixation (the pupil near response), and dilates in response to arousal. In this review, I describe these three pupil responses, including how they are related to high-level cognition, and the neural pathways that control them. Although pupil responses likely serve many functions, not all of which are fully understood, one important function is to optimize vision either for acuity (small pupils see sharper) and depth of field (small pupils see sharply at a wider range of distances), or for sensitivity (large pupils are better able to see faint stimuli); that is, pupils change their size to optimize vision for a particular situation. In many ways, pupil responses are similar to other eye movements, such as saccades and smooth pursuit: like other eye movements, pupil responses are reflexes that are modulated by high-level cognition and attention, and are part of active visual exploration.
